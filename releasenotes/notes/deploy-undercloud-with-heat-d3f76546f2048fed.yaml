features:

    EXPERIMENTAL feature to install the undercloud with openstack heat
    add support for a containerized undercloud.
    The feature is invoked by using the config file in 
    config/general_config/containers_undercloud_minimal.yml 
    e.g. ./quickstart.sh -c $working_dir/config/general_config/containers_undercloud_minimal.yml --tags all -R master-tripleo-ci -w $working_dir $VIRTHOST


deprecations:
  - |
    The variable "undercloud_hieradata_override_file" which was the hieradata
      override file for the overcloud, was deprecated in favor of the
      variables "hieradata_override_file_overcloud" and
      "hieradata_override_file_undercloud". As it now stands as of this patch
      the hieradata override file for the overcloud is
      "hieradata_override_file_overcloud", and hieradata override for the
      undercloud is "hieradata_override_file_undercloud".
